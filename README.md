# Auto-complete-sentences
## google project: 

Search and auto -complete sentences within given input text files, manipulating data with complex data-structures.

The purpose of the project is to give to the user automatic completion for sentences he writes and make it easier for the user to find the most appropriate sentence.

Once entering some text the user will get the five closest completions to the input from pre-given texts.

If there are five sentences that the text is their sub-string, they will be returned. Otherwise will be returned sentences containing the sub-string with one of the changes - a missing letter, additional letter, or a replaced letter.

If the user insert #, start a new string to search.

The results will be from sentences within given input text files.

You can choose from which text files the system will complete the sentences by changing in config file the vaiable: text_files_path to the path of your file or directory
